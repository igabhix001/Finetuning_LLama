However, its signification pattern creates a fundamental contradiction with marriage prospects.\n\n**Rule Application:** Since Venus (the 7th sub-lord) signifies the 6th house (disputes, obstacles) along with the 12th house (losses, separation), it directly opposes the marriage-promoting combinations of houses 2, 7, and 11 as stated in the grounding rule.\n\n**Confidence Level:** HIGH\n\nThe rule clearly states that if the 7th sub-lord connects with 6th or 12th house significations instead of benefic ones like 2nd, 7th, or 11th, marriage gets blocked. Here, Venus's dual connection to both dispute-causing 6th and loss-inducing 12th houses overrides any potential positive influences.\n\n**Practical Implication:** This planetary configuration suggests inherent challenges in marriage materialization - whether through relationship disputes, family opposition, or circumstances leading to losses related to partnerships.\n\nThis demonstrates how precise sub-lord analysis combined with proper rule application provides definitive answers about life events rather than ambiguous predictions",

      "model_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, Saturn's transit will create delays despite the favorable dasha period.\n\n**Quote:** \"Though the matter relates to marriage...the various events about marriage is clearly shown by the sub, transited by the significator.\"\n\n**Rule ID:** KP_MAR_0599\n\nIn this scenario, we have the 7th cusp sub-lord Venus positioned at Aquarius degree 282-37-46. When Saturn (being a natural malefic) transits over this precise natal position of Venus, it creates obstacles that manifest as timing delays rather than complete denial of marriage.\n\nThe key principle here is that while the dasha provides the broad time frame when an event can occur, the actual timing depends on finer planetary influences - specifically which planet acts as the significator currently transiting through sensitive points like the sub-lord's birth position.\n\nSaturn's slow-moving nature ensures its influence persists throughout its transit duration. However, since you mentioned a \"favorable dasha\" already supporting marriage prospects, this indicates the basic promise exists. The transit merely fine-tunes the exact timing within that broader favorable period.\n\nThis demonstrates how KP integrates both macro-level dashas with micro-level transits for precise predictions.\n\nConfidence",

      "model_answer": "Answer: **No**, benefic transit cannot rescue unfavorable marriage timing when sub-lord is weak according to KP principles.\n\n**Quote**: \"If the significator of 6th house is Jupiter and it has entered in Poorvapalguni (133-20'to 146-40') constellation, till it touches Venus Sub and Mercury Sub-sub or Mercury Sub in Venus Star, one cannot be promoted...\"\n\n**Rule ID**: [KP_HEA_0837]\n\nThis fundamental KP principle demonstrates how transit influence operates secondary to natal promise indicated by sub-lords. The key phrase is \"till it touches\" - meaning the beneficial effect remains blocked until specific stellar combinations align.\n\nIn your case with 7th sub-lord Venus being weak (signifying 6th and 12th houses), any positive transit would face similar restrictions. The benefic nature of Jupiter's transit becomes irrelevant when it must wait for supportive nakshatra divisions within its current star position.\n\n**Transit vs Sub-lord Primacy**: In KP system, sub-lord holds supreme authority determining whether an event will manifest favorably. Benefic transits act as supporting agents, but cannot override negative sub-lord promises unless they reach specific stellar positions where",
