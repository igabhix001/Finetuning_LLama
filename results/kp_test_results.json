      "model_answer": "**Verdict:** NO\n\n**Sub-lord Analysis:** Venus as the 7th cusp sub-lord holds the key to marital destiny. However, its signification pattern creates obstacles rather than facilitation.\n\n**Rule Application:** Since Venus signifies the 6th house (disputes, litigation) and 12th house (losses, separation), while lacking connection to beneficial houses 2, 7, and 11 - the fundamental requirement for marriage promise is NOT met according to KP principles.\n\n**Confidence Level:** HIGH\nThe grounding rule clearly states that marriage denial occurs when the 7th cusp sub-lord connects only with 4, 6, 10th houses without touching 2nd, 7th, or 11th houses. Your chart perfectly illustrates this scenario.\n\n**Timing Consideration:** Even if other planetary periods activate positive significators, the foundational weakness created by Venus's unfavorable house connections would manifest during its operational period.\n\n**Practical Implication:** This combination suggests relationship challenges, potential legal disputes, financial losses related to partnerships, or complete avoidance of matrimonial commitments throughout life.\n\n**Source:** KP_MAR_0644 (marriage denial through 4-6-10 house connections)\n\n\n**Additional Note:** The presence of benefic planets like Jupiter and Sun as marriage significators might create temporary opportunities, but the dominant influence of Venus restricts ultimate fulfillment.\n\n**Hence the 12th house to these houses indicates denial of the marriage.**\n\n\n**Dual Sign Connection:** Although not applicable here, examine whether sub-lords occupy dual signs for alternative timing considerations.\n\n\n**Marriage Promise Through Dual Signs:** Check if sub-lord occupies dual signs or constellations ruled by such planets.",

      "model_answer": "Based on the given KP chart analysis:\n\n**Retrograde Sub-Lord Impact Analysis:**\nThe 7th cusp sub-lord Venus signifies houses 1,4,6,9,12 - which are primarily malefic houses indicating obstacles, delays, and separations rather than beneficial marriage indicators (2,7,11).\n\nSince Venus is retrograde AND acts as significator of 6th house (separation/disputes), this creates a strong denial combination according to KP principles.

      "expected_format": "list of stated reasons from KP",
      "model_answer": "**Answer:** Repeated failed engagements are clearly explained by the 6th and 12th house connections through the 7th cusp sub-lord Venus.\n\n**Quote from KP Rule:** \"if the sub lord of the 7th cusp Is in the significator of either of the houses 6 or 12 partnership will break\" - [KP_MAR_1108]\n\nIn your case, Venus as 7th cusp sub-lord signifies both 6th house (disputes, separation, conflicts) and 12th house (losses, endings, dissolution). This dual connection perfectly explains the pattern of broken engagements.\n\nThe **6th house role** creates obstacles, misunderstandings, and irreconcilable differences between partners. It brings disputes that ultimately lead to separation. The **12th house influence** causes losses - emotional, financial, or social - and ensures that relationships dissolve completely rather than transform positively.\n\nThis combination creates what we call \"marriage denial\" in KP terminology. Even when initial attraction exists, the underlying planetary promise manifests as repeated failures at the engagement level itself.\n\nFor remedial measures, focus on strengthening benefic influences during Venus dashas/bhuktis. Look for periods when other planets become stronger significators of 2nd, 7th, 11th houses while minimizing 6th-12th connections. Timing becomes crucial - avoid Venus major/sub periods for marriage-related decisions.\n\nConfidence: high\n\n\nHouses 2, 7, 11 indicate marriage, their 12th houses deny marriage. Sub-lords in constellations of 6, 12 significators cause breaks in partnerships. Marriage cannot take place when sub-lord is in 6, 12 constellations.

This combination specifically points toward \"gains being blocked\" rather than complete denial, as the native possesses the potential but faces consistent hindrances.\n\n**Rule Application:**\nThe grounding rule clearly states that when 11th sub-lords connect to 12th house, gains face significant challenges - either blocked completely or redirected through alternative means. For the 8th sub-lord connecting to 12th, it primarily indicates obstruction in natural transformation processes, creating delays without permanent denial.\n\nConfidence: high\nSource: KP_PRO_0509\nTiming: medium-high\n\n**Redirected Gains Prediction:** \nDue to multiple 12th house connections across both sub-lords, expect significant financial redirections during relevant dasha periods.\n\n**Blocked Transformation Indication:** \nThe 8th sub-lord's 12th house connection strongly suggests persistent obstacles in major life transformations until more favorable planetary configurations emerge.\n\n**Practical Outcome:** \nGains will materialize but through unexpected channels, requiring patience due to repeated blockages.",

While classical systems heavily emphasize planetary strength through rashi lordship, KP prioritizes nakshatra rulership over sign placement.\n\nWhen a debilitated planet like Venus in Virgo occupies Jupiter's nakshatra (like Punarvasu), Jupiter becomes the dominant influence. This creates a unique situation where:\n\n- Debilitation effects become secondary\n- Nakshatra lord's natural characteristics dominate\n- The planet gains strength through its stellar connection\n\nRegarding your specific question about the 7th sub-lord: Yes, if Venus (debilitated but in Jupiter's nakshatra) acts as the 7th cusp sub-lord, Jupiter's benefic nature would significantly mitigate negative marital outcomes. The nakshatra lord's positive qualities would overshadow the debilitation weakness.\n\nThis principle demonstrates KP's revolutionary approach toward planetary evaluation, emphasizing stellar influences over traditional sign-based assessments.\n\n\n**Additional Reference**: For marriage analysis specifically, check [Kp_Mar_0658] regarding 7th cusp sub-lords and their stellar connections.\n\n**Timing Consideration**: During Venus dasha/bhukti periods, Jupiter's protective influence would manifest prominently, potentially overriding debilitation concerns during crucial relationship phases.",
